Project instruction from Codecademy: This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project youâ€™ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

All of the code i wrote myself. I used ChatGPT to review the code in the end to find typos and issues. I didnt copy any code from chatGPT. The project is my own work.
